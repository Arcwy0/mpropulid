# PuLID v1.1

âœ… Release PuLID v1.1 for SDXL models. In this version, we have made the following improvements:
- **stronger ID editability and prompt-following ability**. As shown in the examples below, pulid v1.1 can edit style, viewpoint, expression, lighting, etc., while maintaining a high degree of ID similarity.
- **better compatibility with community models**. According to our tests, PuLID-v1.1 performs well on some popular and powerful base models in the community, such as Juggernaut-XL, RealVisXL, and DreamShaper-XL-Lightning.
- **better naturalness**. We have noted that without any tricks, the faces generated by PuLID-v1 can be somewhat blurry and lack detail. The v1.1 version, when combined with more powerful base models, has shown improvements in facial clarity and naturalness.
- ID similarity has beed slightly improved.
 

Following are some examples generated by PuLID-v1.1, you can reproduce these results from our Gradio demo.
